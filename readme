# Call Analysis Project
 
## Description

New York City publishes a number of [open datasets](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) for public consumption or use. Amongst them is a dataset consisting of calls to the [311 phone number](https://www.ny.gov/agencies/nyc-311) for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. In this project, we work with a yearâ€™s worth of data from this dataset and answer a number of questions about it. This is [the data (around 1.5GB)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BRd8_RSST69UaZRBeD_dtXGw9fuKoBZE?usp=sharing) we use.

In the first Jupyter notebook called 
[Top10.ipynb](https://github.com/JuexinPeng/Call-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Top10.ipynb), we analyze what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our chosen ZIP code, and calculate how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. 

In the second Jupyter notebook called 
[Parking.ipynb](https://github.com/JuexinPeng/Call-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Parking.ipynb), we analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code than they are in general. Specifically, we compute the total number of parking incidents in our ZIP, and the total number of all incidents. Then we check whether this fraction is greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes.
